# First step: Setting up the environment
In this step you should decide wether you want to test your project **locally** or **virtually**.

# Local testing using Docker
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. It enables 
developers to package applications into containers (standarized executable components combining application source code with the OS libraries and 
dependencies required to run that code in any environment. This will enable you to break down your application into several components and test each
one individually or as a whole application. A benifit of local testing using containers is that they are more lightweight than virtual machines, as their
images are measured in megabytes rather than gigabytes and require fewer resources to deploy, run, and manage.
